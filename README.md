SentriX is an autonomous, enterprise-grade incident detection and self-healing platform.

It integrates with GitHub repositories to:

- Detect failures
- Perform structured Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Propose safe remediation
- Validate fixes before merge

Designed using a multi-agent architecture inspired by real SRE workflows.
